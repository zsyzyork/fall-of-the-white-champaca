# 第廿九回 开幕式巧心成正果，贺岁宴急症引危情

李博士开门见山问道：“I'm looking for the Dancer in your class. You know who's the Dancer? ”思敏忙道：“I dance. Are you looking for me? ”李博士不知是将信将疑，还是美国人特有的故作惊讶，声音提高八度道：“You do?! ”思敏怕他不信，便往前走了几步，走到教室视线看不到的空地，将开幕式卢琪儿所跳之舞，依样表演了一段。李博士看得连连点头道“Terrific! ”又道：“I've got a question for you - How much do you like the States?”

思敏仔细揣测了一会对方想听的话，才组织语言道：“I think it's a land of opportunity, a place where everyone can chase the American Dream. It's not about who studies the hardest. You also need to be good many at other things in order to succeed. ”

李博士追问道：“Other things. Like what? ”思敏将李博士的履历在脑中过了一遍，概括道：“Like how to get chances, how to take actions, how to find resources, and being flexible. You cannot rely on knowledge from the books. ”

李博士果然激动道：“Exacly! Being book-smart doesn't get you anywhere. Hey, I think you'll do well if you study abroad.”

思敏听了这话，心中狂喜，却按捺住言表的欣悦，以退为进地试探道：“Thank you. But I don't think I can afford it. ”李博士摆手道：“Don't worry about it. What I'm gonna do... is to give you my number...”边说边从衣袋里摸出纸笔，写下自己的行动电话号码，又叮嘱道：“When you go home, ask your parents to call me. Okay? ”

思敏乖巧道：“Okay. Thank you very much, Dr. Lee. It's nice talking with you. ”李博士回道：“Nice meeting you too... Oh, your name is? ”思敏道：“My name is Simi.”

“Simi! ”李博士甩出个自认为帅气的比“七”手势，指向思敏笑道，“And I'll see YOU! Good luck! ”
